Lately, I have been researching on building communities and was looking at some paid communities on SKOOL. While browsing, I found something interesting: there's a paid community for everything. So then I came across a community called \"This world is a simulation\". It was charging $55/month and had 644 members. That's nearly $350,000 in annual revenue. What is the community about? Manifesting! True, I'm not kidding. It's just about manifesting - How to Win the Lottery - How to Manifest $10,000 & $100,000 - How to Manifest $3 Million dollars - How to Manifest Your SP (Don't even know what that means). Crazy to see how people are spending their money. Maybe there's a lesson here for us all. If a community centered around manifesting can generate $350,000 a year, anyone can start a community, specialize in their niche, and provide real value.",
